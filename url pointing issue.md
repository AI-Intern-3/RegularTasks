PHP application is still pointing to the old URL despite changing it to the new one. 

There are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. **Clear Cache and Cookies (Local Browser)**
   - If the old URL is being cached in your browser, try clearing the cache and cookies. This will ensure that your browser loads the latest version of the application.
   - You can also try opening the site in **incognito mode** to bypass cached files.

### 2. **Clear Server-Side Cache**
   - If you have any server-side caching mechanisms (e.g., **OPcache**, **Varnish**, or a caching plugin in AA panel), clear those caches.
   - **OPcache** (for PHP) might store the old file in memory. You can reset the OPcache by:
     ```php
     opcache_reset();
     ```
     Or, restart the PHP service:
     ```bash
     sudo service php7.x-fpm restart  # Adjust the version number as needed
     ```

### 3. **Check for Hardcoded URLs**
   - Make sure that the old URL isn't hardcoded in any of your PHP files. Search through your project to see if there are any places where the old URL is still being referenced.

### 4. **Update Configuration Files**
   - Check your **Apache** or **Nginx** configuration to ensure that it is pointing to the correct domain. Sometimes the server itself may have old references.

   For **Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
   ```
   For **Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

### 5. **Check AA Panel for Domain Settings**
   - In the AA panel, ensure the domain configuration has been updated with the new pointing URL. Sometimes the panel may need to be refreshed or reconfigured to use the new domain.

### 6. **Restart Web Server**
   - After making changes, restart your web server (Apache/Nginx) to apply them:
     ```bash
     sudo service apache2 restart  # For Apache
     sudo service nginx restart    # For Nginx
     ```

### 7. **Clear DNS Cache**
   - Your machine or local network may have cached the DNS pointing to the old URL. To clear it:
     ```bash
     sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches  # For Linux
     ipconfig /flushdns                   # For Windows
     ```

These steps should help resolve the issue of your PHP application pointing to the old URL. Let me know if the issue persists after trying these solutions!
