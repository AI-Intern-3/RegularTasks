To configure Bitbucket with Jira, you can follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have administrator access to both Bitbucket and Jira.
- Make sure both Bitbucket and Jira are properly installed and accessible.

### Step 1: **Install the Jira Bitbucket Connector Plugin**
1. **Log in to Jira:**
   - Log in to your Jira instance with administrator privileges.

2. **Navigate to Manage Apps:**
   - Go to **Jira Administration** > **Manage apps**.

3. **Find and Install the Plugin:**
   - Search for "Jira Bitbucket Connector" or similar.
   - Install the plugin by following the on-screen instructions.

### Step 2: **Create an Application Link in Jira**
1. **Access Application Links:**
   - In Jira, go to **Jira Administration** > **System**.
   - Under the **Integrations** section, click on **Application links**.

2. **Create a New Application Link:**
   - Enter the URL of your Bitbucket instance and click **Create new link**.
   - In the popup, confirm the URL, then click **Continue**.

3. **Configure Application Link:**
   - Set **Application Name** to "Bitbucket".
   - For **Application Type**, select **Bitbucket**.
   - Configure the authentication settings (OAuth) as required.
   - Click **Create Application Link**.

### Step 3: **Configure Repository Settings in Bitbucket**
1. **Log in to Bitbucket:**
   - Log in to your Bitbucket instance with administrator privileges.

2. **Configure Global Jira Integration:**
   - Go to **Bitbucket Administration** > **Jira Integration** (may be under **Integrations**).
   - Add your Jira Server by entering the Jira URL and authenticating.

3. **Link Repositories to Jira Projects:**
   - Link specific Bitbucket repositories to Jira projects by specifying the repositories and projects to be connected.

### Step 4: **Set Up Webhooks in Bitbucket**
1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to the specific repository you want to link.
   - Click on **Repository settings** > **Webhooks**.

2. **Add a Webhook:**
   - Click **Add webhook**.
   - Enter a title and the Jira webhook URL (usually found in Jiraâ€™s incoming webhook configuration).
   - Select the events you want the webhook to trigger (e.g., push, pull request).
   - Save the webhook.

3. **Repeat for All Relevant Repositories:**
   - Set up similar webhooks for all repositories that need to be linked to Jira.

### Step 5: **Test the Integration**
1. **Create a Commit with a Jira Issue Key:**
   - In Bitbucket, make a commit that includes a Jira issue key in the commit message (e.g., "PROJECT-123 Fixed a bug").

2. **Verify in Jira:**
   - Check the corresponding Jira issue to see if the commit appears under the Development section.

### Step 6: **Manage and Monitor Integration**
1. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regularly monitor the integration for any issues.
   - Ensure webhooks are working correctly and the repositories are linked properly.

This setup will allow you to track development work from Bitbucket within Jira, ensuring that you have a clear view of code changes and their relation to Jira issues.
