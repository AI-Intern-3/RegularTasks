The "connection setup" typically refers to the configuration details that allow testers (or other users) to access and interact with the environments for testing or development purposes. For *Cjn* and *SmartCookie*, this could involve several components:

### Components of Connection Setup:

1. **URLs/Endpoints:**
   - **Cjn Testing URL:** Provide the URL where the testing environment for the *Cjn* website is hosted.
   - **SmartCookie Testing URL:** Provide the URL for the *SmartCookie* testing environment.

2. **Credentials:**
   - **Username and Password:** The login credentials required to access the websites or any associated tools (like admin panels or APIs).
   - **API Keys/Tokens (if applicable):** Any API keys or tokens if the tester needs to interact with an API.

3. **Database Access:**
   - **Connection Strings:** If the tester needs to access the database directly, provide the connection string, including the host, port, database name, username, and password.
   - **SQL Clients:** Suggest any specific SQL clients or tools they should use to connect to the database.

4. **Network Configurations:**
   - **VPN Access:** If the websites are hosted on a private network, provide VPN credentials or setup details.
   - **Firewall Rules:** Ensure that the necessary ports are open for the tester to access the servers or databases.

5. **Environment Information:**
   - **Environment Type:** Specify whether the environment is for development, testing, staging, or production.
   - **Environment Variables:** Provide any specific environment variables or configurations that might be needed for the testing environment.

6. **Documentation:**
   - **Setup Guides:** If there are any specific setup instructions or documentation, share these with the tester.
   - **Known Issues/Configurations:** Any known issues or special configurations that the tester should be aware of.

### Example Setup Information:
Here's a hypothetical example of what you might provide:

#### Cjn Connection Setup:
- **URL:** `https://cjn-test.example.com`
- **Username:** `tester_cjn`
- **Password:** `password123`
- **Database Connection String:** `jdbc:mysql://cjn-db.example.com:3306/cjn_db?user=tester&password=dbpassword`
- **VPN Access:** Required – [VPN Setup Guide]
- **Environment Type:** Staging
- **Notes:** Ensure you clear cache after each test to avoid session-related issues.

#### SmartCookie Connection Setup:
- **URL:** `https://smartcookie-test.example.com`
- **Username:** `tester_smartcookie`
- **Password:** `password456`
- **Database Connection String:** `jdbc:postgresql://smartcookie-db.example.com:5432/smartcookie_db?user=tester&password=dbpassword`
- **VPN Access:** Not required
- **Environment Type:** Development
- **Notes:** Watch out for timeouts when accessing the admin panel due to ongoing optimizations.

Providing the above details should help the tester connect and start their testing tasks. If you’re unsure about any specifics, you may need to check with your development or IT team for the exact configuration.
