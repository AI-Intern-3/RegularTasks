Renewing an SSL certificate in cPanel is quite similar to the initial installation process. Here is a step-by-step guide to renew your SSL certificate:

### Step 1: Purchase and Obtain the Renewal SSL Certificate
1. **Purchase Renewal**: Buy an SSL renewal from your SSL provider.
2. **Generate CSR**: (If required) Generate a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
   - Log in to cPanel.
   - Navigate to the **Security** section.
   - Click on **SSL/TLS**.
   - Click on **Generate, view, or delete SSL certificate signing requests**.
   - Fill in the required details and generate the CSR.
3. **Submit CSR**: Submit the CSR to your SSL provider to receive the new SSL certificate files.

### Step 2: Install the Renewed SSL Certificate
1. **Log in to cPanel**: Access your cPanel account.
2. **Navigate to SSL/TLS**:
   - Go to the **Security** section.
   - Click on **SSL/TLS**.
3. **Manage SSL Sites**:
   - Click on **Manage SSL sites** under the **Install and Manage SSL for your site (HTTPS)** section.
4. **Install Renewed Certificate**:
   - In the **Domain** dropdown, select the domain for which you are renewing the SSL certificate.
   - **Certificate (CRT)**: Copy and paste the new SSL certificate provided by your SSL issuer into the **Certificate (CRT)** field.
   - **Private Key (KEY)**: This should be automatically filled in if you generated the CSR in cPanel. If not, paste the private key you received during CSR generation.
   - **Certificate Authority Bundle (CABUNDLE)**: Paste the CA bundle provided by your SSL issuer into this field.
5. **Install Certificate**: Click the **Install Certificate** button to complete the installation of the renewed SSL certificate.

### Step 3: Verify the Renewal
1. **Browser Check**: Open your website in a browser using `https://` and check if the SSL certificate is properly installed.
2. **SSL Checker**: Use online tools like SSL Checker to verify the SSL renewal.

### Step 4: Check and Renew Before Expiry
1. **Check Expiry**: Regularly check the expiration date of your SSL certificate.
2. **Renew Certificate**: Plan to renew the SSL certificate before it expires by following the same process above.

Following these steps should ensure that your SSL certificate is renewed successfully in cPanel. If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out to your hosting provider's support for help.
