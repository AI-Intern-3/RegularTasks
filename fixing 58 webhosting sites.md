### Fixing Website Errors on GoDaddy Webservers

#### Common Steps:

1. **Check DNS Settings:**
   - Ensure DNS settings are correct and properly propagated for each domain.
   - Use tools like `dig` or online DNS checkers to verify DNS settings.

2. **Check Server Status:**
   - Ensure the server is running and not experiencing downtime.
   - Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to verify server accessibility.

3. **Verify File Permissions:**
   - Ensure proper permissions are set for files (644) and directories (755).
   - Use commands like `chmod` and `chown` to adjust permissions if needed.

4. **Review Web Server Configuration:**
   - Check Apache or Nginx configuration files for any misconfigurations.
   - Ensure the virtual host configurations are correct.

5. **Check Application Logs:**
   - Review application logs for errors that might provide clues.
   - Logs are typically found in `/var/log` or a specific directory set by the application.

6. **Verify Database Connection:**
   - Ensure the database server is running and accessible.
   - Check database connection settings (username, password, database name) in the application configuration.

7. **Review .htaccess Files:**
   - Ensure there are no restrictive rules causing forbidden errors.
   - Make necessary adjustments to allow access.

8. **Check Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure there are no network issues blocking access to the server.
   - Verify firewall settings and ensure necessary ports are open.
