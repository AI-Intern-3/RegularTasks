Automate the download of videos from Zoom cloud storage and upload them to an S3 bucket using AWS Lambda. Here’s a detailed guide on how you can achieve this:

### **Steps to Automate Download from Zoom Cloud Storage and Upload to S3 Using AWS Lambda**

#### **1. Set Up Zoom API Access**
- **Create a Zoom App:** Ensure that your Zoom app is configured with the necessary API scopes. You’ll need scopes like `recording:read` to access cloud recordings.
- **Get API Credentials:** Note down your Zoom OAuth credentials: `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Account ID`.

#### **2. Prepare Your AWS Environment**
- **Create an S3 Bucket:** This will be the destination for your videos.
- **Create an IAM Role:** This role should have permissions to access S3 and invoke Lambda. Attach policies like `AmazonS3FullAccess` and `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`.

#### **3. Create the Lambda Function**
- **Navigate to AWS Lambda:** Go to the AWS Management Console and create a new Lambda function.
- **Choose a Runtime:** Select Python as the runtime.
- **Attach the IAM Role:** Use the role you created earlier.
  
#### **4. Write the Lambda Function Code**

Here’s a sample Python code for your Lambda function:

```python
import boto3
import requests
import os

# AWS and Zoom configuration
S3_BUCKET_NAME = 'your-s3-bucket-name'
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID = os.environ['ZOOM_CLIENT_ID']
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ['ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET']
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID = os.environ['ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID']

# Create S3 client
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

def get_zoom_oauth_token():
    token_url = "https://zoom.us/oauth/token"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Basic {ZOOM_CLIENT_ID}:{ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET}"
    }
    data = {
        "grant_type": "account_credentials",
        "account_id": ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID
    }
    response = requests.post(token_url, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response.json().get('access_token')

def download_zoom_video(download_url, file_name):
    response = requests.get(download_url, stream=True)
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)
    return file_name

def upload_to_s3(file_name, bucket_name, s3_file_name):
    s3_client.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, s3_file_name)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    access_token = get_zoom_oauth_token()
    
    # Assuming `event` contains the download URL and file name
    download_url = event['download_url']
    file_name = event['file_name']
    
    downloaded_file = download_zoom_video(download_url, file_name)
    upload_to_s3(downloaded_file, S3_BUCKET_NAME, file_name)

    # Cleanup
    os.remove(downloaded_file)
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "Video downloaded and uploaded to S3 successfully!"
    }
```

#### **5. Set Environment Variables in Lambda**
- Go to the “Configuration” tab of your Lambda function.
- Set the environment variables for `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`.

#### **6. Set Up a Trigger for the Lambda Function**
- **CloudWatch Event:** You can schedule the Lambda function to run periodically using a CloudWatch Event.
- **API Gateway (Optional):** If you want to invoke the Lambda function via an API, set up an API Gateway trigger.

#### **7. Test Your Lambda Function**
- **Invoke the Lambda Function:** You can test the function by manually invoking it with an event that includes the `download_url` and `file_name`.
- **Check S3 Bucket:** Verify if the video is uploaded to your S3 bucket.

#### **8. Monitor and Log**
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Ensure logging is set up in your Lambda function for debugging and monitoring.
- **Alerting (Optional):** Set up alerts using SNS if the Lambda function fails or if there are errors in the upload process.

### **Notes**
- You may need to handle Zoom’s OAuth token expiration and refresh mechanism if your application runs for a long time.
- Make sure the download URL from Zoom is accessible and correctly formatted for direct download.
- Adjust the chunk size and other parameters in the `download_zoom_video` function based on your needs.

This setup allows you to automate the process using serverless architecture, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.
