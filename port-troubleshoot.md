To make port 8080 open on Contabo for Jira access, you need to ensure that the port is open in both the server's firewall and any cloud-based firewall or security group settings that Contabo provides.

### Steps to Open Port 8080 on Contabo

#### 1. **Check the Server's Firewall**

1. **Check if `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) is installed and active**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

2. **Allow traffic on port 8080**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
   ```

3. **Reload `ufw` to apply the changes**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

#### 2. **Check Contabo Cloud Firewall/Security Group Settings**

Contabo might have its own firewall settings that you need to configure:

1. **Log in to the Contabo customer control panel**.
2. **Navigate to your server's settings**.
3. **Find the firewall or security group settings**.
4. **Add a rule to allow inbound traffic on port 8080**.

#### 3. **Restart Jira**

After opening the port, restart Jira to ensure it binds to port 8080 correctly:

```bash
sudo su - jira
cd /opt/jira/bin
./stop-jira.sh
./start-jira.sh
```

#### 4. **Verify Port 8080 is Open**

1. **Check if Jira is listening on port 8080**:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8080
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tuln | grep 8080
   ```

2. **Verify with Browser**

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://<your_server_ip>:8080
```

### Summary

- Ensure the server's firewall allows traffic on port 8080 (`ufw` for Ubuntu).
- Configure any cloud-based firewall or security group settings in Contabo to allow port 8080.
- Restart Jira to ensure it binds to the correct port.
- Verify the port is open and Jira is accessible via a web browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to open port 8080 on your Contabo server for Jira access.
