To deploy your Flask application on GoDaddy using the steps in your reference, you need to adapt the process for your specific project. Below is a guide tailored to your project:

### 1. Set Up Python Application in cPanel
- **Log into cPanel** and go to **"Setup Python App"** under the Software section.
- **Choose the Python version** (preferably the version your app uses).
- Set the following:
  - **Application root**: `/home/techindi/interview.cjn.com`
  - **Application URL**: Set your domain or subdomain.
  - **Application entry point**: Set this as `main:app`, assuming your `main.py` contains the Flask app.

Once saved, GoDaddy will create a basic `passenger_wsgi.py` file. You will need to adapt it as follows:

### 2. Modify `passenger_wsgi.py`
1. Go to the **"File Manager"** in cPanel and find the `passenger_wsgi.py` file created in your `/home/techindi/interview.cjn.com` directory.
2. Edit the file with the following content:
   
   ```python
   import sys, os

   # Add project root to the sys path
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))

   # Add the virtual environment's packages to the sys path
   venvpath = '/home/techindi/virtualenv/interview.cjn.com/lib/python3.7/site-packages'
   sys.path.insert(0, venvpath)

   # Import the Flask application
   from main import app as application  # Assuming app is defined in main.py
   ```

### 3. Activate Your Virtual Environment
- **Activate the virtual environment** created by GoDaddy:
  ```bash
  $ source /home/techindi/virtualenv/interview.cjn.com/3.7/bin/activate
  ```
- **Update pip**:
  ```bash
  $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
- **Install necessary Python packages**, including Flask and others from your app's `requirements.txt` (you can upload the file if needed):
  ```bash
  $ pip install flask
  $ pip install -r /home/techindi/interview.cjn.com/requirements.txt
  ```

### 4. Update `.htaccess`
The `.htaccess` file in your application directory might need changes. Add the following lines if needed:
```apache
# DO NOT REMOVE. CLOUDLINUX PASSENGER CONFIGURATION BEGIN
PassengerAppRoot "/home/techindi/interview.cjn.com"
PassengerBaseURI "/"
PassengerPython "/home/techindi/virtualenv/interview.cjn.com/3.7/bin/python"
PassengerAppLogFile "/home/techindi/interview.cjn.com/logs/app.log"
# DO NOT REMOVE. CLOUDLINUX PASSENGER CONFIGURATION END

# Turn off directory index if necessary
Options -Indexes
```

### 5. Restart the Application
- To avoid cPanel overwriting your files when restarting, use the following command:
  ```bash
  $ touch tmp/restart.txt
  ```

This should restart your app without overwriting any custom configurations.
