To properly address the issue you're experiencing with your VPS, here are **detailed steps** on how to create an MTR report and provide the necessary information to the support team:

### **Step 1: Install MTR on Your Server**

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
1. SSH into your VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh user@your_server_ip
   ```
2. Install the `mtr` tool:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mtr
   ```

#### For CentOS/RHEL:
1. SSH into your VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh user@your_server_ip
   ```
2. Install `mtr` using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install mtr
   ```

#### For Windows:
1. Download **WinMTR** from [WinMTR download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/).
2. Install and run **WinMTR**.

### **Step 2: Generate MTR Report**

#### For Linux:
1. Run the MTR report by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo mtr -r -c 100 your_server_ip
   ```
   - Replace `your_server_ip` with the **destination server's IP** (the server you want to test the connection to).
   - The `-r` flag generates a report, and `-c 100` runs 100 tests for more accurate results.

2. The report will show a detailed analysis of the network hops between your machine and the destination.

#### For Windows (WinMTR):
1. Open **WinMTR**.
2. Enter the IP address of the destination server in the "Host" field.
3. Click **Start**.
4. After running for a few minutes, click **Stop** and then click **Copy Text to Clipboard** to save the report.

### **Step 3: Take a Screenshot of the Issue**
1. Recreate the issue youâ€™re facing on your VPS.
2. Take a **screenshot** showing the issue clearly.
   - For Windows: Press `Windows + Shift + S` and select the area to capture.
   - For macOS: Press `Command + Shift + 4`.
   - For Linux: Use a screenshot tool or press `PrtSc` on your keyboard.

### **Step 4: Prepare Login Credentials**
- Make sure you include the **SSH credentials** to access your VPS.
  - **IP address** of the server.
  - **SSH user** (e.g., `root` or another user).
  - **SSH password** or private key for login.

### **Step 5: Send the Information**
1. Send the following information to the support team via their provided support email or ticketing system:
   - **MTR report**.
   - **Login credentials** (IP address, username, and password/private key).
   - **Screenshot** of the issue.
2. Include a detailed description of the issue you're facing.

### **Additional Documentation**

- If necessary, stay in touch with them for further clarifications or actions.

By following these steps, you'll provide the necessary information for the support team to diagnose and resolve your issue efficiently.
