To automate the task of checking whether all 58 web applications hosted on GoDaddy are working and their associated databases are functional, you can use Python to read the list of web servers from an Excel file, check the availability of each website, and verify database connectivity.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Steps to Automate the Task:

1. **Read the Excel File:**
   - Use the `pandas` library to read the Excel file that contains the list of web server URLs and database connection details.

2. **Check Website Availability:**
   - Use the `requests` library to send a GET request to each URL and check if the response status code is 200 (OK).

3. **Check Database Connectivity:**
   - Depending on the type of database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), use the appropriate database connector (e.g., `mysql.connector`, `psycopg2`) to try connecting to the database and execute a simple query.

4. **Log Results:**
   - Log the results of each check to a file or Excel sheet for further analysis.

### Example Python Script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import mysql.connector  # Or use appropriate connector for your database
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='web_check.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Read the Excel file
file_path = 'webserver_list.xlsx'  # Replace with your file path
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Example columns: URL, DB_Host, DB_User, DB_Password, DB_Name
# Adjust these column names based on your Excel file

def check_website(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            logging.info(f"Website {url} is up.")
            return True
        else:
            logging.warning(f"Website {url} returned status code {response.status_code}.")
            return False
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Website {url} is down. Error: {e}")
        return False

def check_database(db_host, db_user, db_password, db_name):
    try:
        conn = mysql.connector.connect(
            host=db_host,
            user=db_user,
            password=db_password,
            database=db_name
        )
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT 1")  # Simple query to test connection
        conn.close()
        logging.info(f"Database {db_name} on {db_host} is up.")
        return True
    except mysql.connector.Error as e:
        logging.error(f"Database {db_name} on {db_host} is down. Error: {e}")
        return False

def main():
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        url = row['URL']
        db_host = row['DB_Host']
        db_user = row['DB_User']
        db_password = row['DB_Password']
        db_name = row['DB_Name']

        website_status = check_website(url)
        database_status = check_database(db_host, db_user, db_password, db_name)

        if website_status and database_status:
            logging.info(f"Website {url} and its database are both up.")
        else:
            logging.error(f"Either website {url} or its database is down.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **`pandas`**: Used to read the Excel file containing URLs and database details.
- **`check_website(url)`**: Sends a GET request to each URL and checks if the website is up.
- **`check_database(db_host, db_user, db_password, db_name)`**: Tries to connect to the database and execute a query to verify it's functioning.
- **Logging**: The results are logged in `web_check.log`, providing a record of which websites and databases are working or not.

### Customization:

- Ensure the Excel file has the necessary columns (`URL`, `DB_Host`, `DB_User`, `DB_Password`, `DB_Name`), and adjust the script accordingly if the columns are named differently.
- Use the appropriate database connector based on the type of database you are using.
- You can also expand this script to handle different types of databases or log the results back into an Excel file instead of a log file.

This script will help you automate the verification of all 58 web applications and their associated databases.
